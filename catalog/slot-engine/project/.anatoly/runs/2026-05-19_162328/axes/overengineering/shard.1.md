## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|

| `src/strategy.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 0 | 90% | [details](#srcstrategyts) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Hand-rolled IoC/DI container for exactly three items (rng, paytable, reels) that are already directly imported at the top of the file. The class adds a string-keyed, untyped Map lookup where direct references would be zero-overhead and fully type-safe. No injection ever occurs — entries are hardcoded in the module. This is a classic premature-abstraction of a dependency-injection pattern with a single, hardcoded instantiation. |

## 🧹 Hygiene

- [ ] <!-- ACT-28c3e3-8 --> **[overengineering · medium · small]** `src/engine.ts`: Simplify: `EngineContainer` is over-engineered (`EngineContainer`) [L17-L27]
- [ ] <!-- ACT-e0699c-2 --> **[overengineering · medium · small]** `src/strategy.ts`: Simplify: `SpinStrategy` is over-engineered `SpinStrategy`, `DefaultStrategy`, `ConservativeStrategy` (`SpinStrategy, DefaultStrategy, ConservativeStrategy`) [L3-L5, L7-L11, L13-L20]
