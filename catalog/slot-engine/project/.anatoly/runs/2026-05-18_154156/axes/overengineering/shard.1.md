## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 92% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/factories.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcfactoriests) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Hand-rolled IoC/DI container (register/resolve over a `Map<string,unknown>`) for exactly 3 values that are already statically imported at the top of the file. `container.resolve<typeof weightedPick>("rng")` just returns the same function registered two lines above. Provides zero decoupling, adds unsafe `as T` casts, and `rng` resolved from the container is never actually called inside `spin`. A direct reference to the imported functions is all that is needed. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 90% | Class wrapping a 4-line loop that calls `spinReel`. `_rowCount` is accepted but ignored, signalling premature generalization. With 1 importer and no interface benefit (the abstract base has 0 importers), this is a factory pattern applied where a standalone function suffices. |
