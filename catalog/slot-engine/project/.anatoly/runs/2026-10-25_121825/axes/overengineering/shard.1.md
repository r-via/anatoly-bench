## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 97% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/events.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srceventsts) |
| `src/factories.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcfactoriests) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 90% | Hand-rolled DI container (register/resolve on a Map) for three symbols that are already statically imported at the top of the file. All three registrations immediately below use the same imported references — the container adds a stringly-typed indirection with no testability or configurability benefit. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 88% | Reimplements Node.js built-in EventEmitter (on/off/emit over a Map<string, handler[]>) with zero additional behavior. Has exactly 1 importer (src/engine.ts::spin). Node's native `require('events').EventEmitter` or `import { EventEmitter } from 'events'` provides this identically with no install cost. NIH on a stdlib symbol for a single consumer. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 85% | Factory class wrapping a 4-line for-loop calling spinReel. `_rowCount` is accepted but unused, revealing the abstraction doesn't even fit its own interface contract. A plain exported function would remove the class, the abstract base, and the dead parameter with no loss of clarity. |
