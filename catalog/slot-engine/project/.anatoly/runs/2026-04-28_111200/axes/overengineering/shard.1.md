## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🔴 CRITICAL | 1 | 95% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/events.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srceventsts) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 85% | A hand-rolled IoC/DI container (register + resolve with an untyped Map<string, unknown>) whose sole purpose is to hold three values (`rng`, `paytable`, `reels`) that are already available as direct module-level imports. All three are retrieved once in `spin` and could be called directly. The pattern imposes type-unsafe casts (`as T`) and indirection with no testability or extensibility benefit visible anywhere in the file. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 80% | Auto-promoted: exported class imported by 1 file — abstraction built for a single client |

## 🧹 Hygiene

- [ ] <!-- ACT-28c3e3-7 --> **[overengineering · medium · small]** `src/engine.ts`: Simplify: `Bet` is over-engineered `Bet`, `DEBUG_MODE`, `EngineContainer`, `container` (`Bet, DEBUG_MODE, EngineContainer, container`) [L12-L12, L15-L15, L17-L27, L29-L29]
- [ ] <!-- ACT-7dd2fe-1 --> **[overengineering · medium · small]** `src/events.ts`: Simplify: `SpinEventEmitter` is over-engineered (`SpinEventEmitter`) [L3-L25]
