## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 97% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/events.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srceventsts) |
| `src/factories.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcfactoriests) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 90% | Hand-rolled IoC container (register/resolve Map) wraps three static imports that are already in scope. One instantiation, one consumer (spin). Direct calls to weightedPick, getPayMultiplier, getReelSymbols/getReelWeights would be equivalent with zero indirection. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 88% | Hand-rolled reimplementation of Node.js built-in `EventEmitter` (`require('events')`), which natively provides `on`, `off` (removeListener), and `emit` with the same semantics. Single consumer (src/engine.ts::spin) per usage analysis, so there is no generality benefit that would justify avoiding the built-in. NIH: the native EventEmitter covers this entirely without any install. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 85% | Factory class wrapping a trivial loop over spinReel calls. The `_rowCount` param is silently ignored (prefixed underscore), exposing that the interface contract doesn't even match real usage. This is a plain function disguised as a factory; the class + inheritance ceremony is unjustified for a single consumer. |
