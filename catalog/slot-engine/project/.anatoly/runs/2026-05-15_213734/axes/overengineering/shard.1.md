## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | DIY service-locator for exactly 3 statically-imported functions. Uses Map<string, unknown> losing type safety, then casts with `as T` on every resolve. No inversion of control is achieved — the same three imports (`weightedPick`, `getPayMultiplier`, `getReelSymbols/getReelWeights`) could be used directly. Single instantiation, single consumer. Textbook premature abstraction. |

### `src/reels.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `REEL_WEIGHTS` | L22–L28 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Five identical rows produced by calling weightsToArray(DEFAULT_WEIGHTS) five times. All reels share the same weights (confirmed by reference docs), so storing a 2-D array of duplicates adds indirection. A single shared weights array passed into spinReel would suffice. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 88% | Factory class wrapping a trivial 3-line loop. The `_rowCount` parameter is silently ignored (underscore-prefixed), exposing a parameterisation that was never implemented — a sign the abstraction was designed for hypothetical future variants. A free function `buildReels(reelCount: number): Symbol[][]` is sufficient and has 1 real caller. The factory/class pattern adds ceremony with no polymorphic or lifecycle value. |
