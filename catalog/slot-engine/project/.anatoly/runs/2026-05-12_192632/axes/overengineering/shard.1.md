## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Hand-rolled DI container (Map + stringly-typed register/resolve with unsafe cast) used exclusively to re-expose three already-imported module functions. All three registered values are resolvable directly via their imports and consumed in a single call site (spin). No test doubles, no swappable implementations, no multi-consumer scenario — zero benefit from the indirection layer. |

### `src/reels.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `REEL_WEIGHTS` | L22–L28 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Five identical calls to weightsToArray(DEFAULT_WEIGHTS) stored in a 2D array. Since all reels share the same weights (confirmed by internal docs), this could be a single weights array reused directly. The per-reel structure implies per-reel configurability that is never used. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 80% | Auto-promoted: exported class imported by 1 file — abstraction built for a single client |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 85% | Wraps a trivial for-loop in a full class hierarchy. The `_rowCount` parameter is silently ignored, leaking an ill-fitting abstraction from the parent. A plain exported function `buildReels(reelCount: number): Symbol[][]` would be cleaner, directly testable, and eliminate the unused parameter without losing any capability. |
