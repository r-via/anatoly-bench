## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 92% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/events.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srceventsts) |
| `src/factories.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcfactoriests) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Hand-rolled IoC/DI container (register/resolve with a Map) used solely in this file to wrap three statically-imported symbols (`weightedPick`, `getPayMultiplier`, `getReelSymbols`/`getReelWeights`). None of these registrations are ever overridden or swapped; direct calls to the imports would be identical. Unnecessary indirection layer with no testability or extensibility benefit in practice. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 90% | Reimplements Node.js built-in `EventEmitter` (NIH). Has exactly 1 consumer using exactly 1 event (`SPIN_DONE`); the full on/off/emit pub-sub pattern is disproportionate — a direct callback argument or a returned Promise would be sufficient at this scale. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 90% | Factory class pattern for what is effectively a single two-liner loop over spinReel(). One importer (engine.ts::spin) instantiates it to call buildReels once. A standalone function `buildReels(reelCount, rowCount)` would be simpler and equally testable. |
