## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/events.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srceventsts) |
| `src/factories.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcfactoriests) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Full registry/IoC container (Map, generic resolve<T>) for three static module-level imports. All three could be imported and called directly with no indirection. Two of the three resolutions (rng, reelsModule) go unused after being resolved in spin(), making the container even less justified. The pattern implies runtime swappability that the codebase never exercises. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 82% | Hand-rolled event bus reimplementing Node.js's built-in `EventEmitter` (on/off/emit + Map-based listener registry). Only 1 importer, only 1 event constant in use (SPIN_DONE), and the emitter is constructed and immediately discarded per spin() call — the off() method is effectively dead code in this lifecycle. A direct callback parameter or Node's `EventEmitter` (zero-install, built-in) would be proportionate. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 88% | Wraps a trivial 5-line loop in a class hierarchy solely to satisfy the abstract factory above. `_rowCount` is ignored, exposing that the abstraction generalizes beyond what the engine actually uses. A plain exported function `buildReels(reelCount: number): Symbol[][]` would be equivalent and far simpler. |
