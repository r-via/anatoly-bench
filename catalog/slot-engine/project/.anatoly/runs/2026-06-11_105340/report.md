### Divergences code ↔ reference

- **[tests · warn]** `computePayout` in `src/engine.ts`:101
  - Reference (`src/engine.ts JSDoc comment on computePayout`): _"Applies the house edge to maintain a target RTP of approximately 95%."_
  - Observed: HOUSE_EDGE=0.05 is multiplied onto wins (total * 1.05), which increases payouts rather than reducing them toward 95% RTP. Additionally, bet*0.01 is unconditionally added regardless of whether there are wins, further inflating RTP beyond the documented target.
- **[best_practices · warn]** `getReelWeights` in `src/reels.ts`:57
  - Reference (`.anatoly/state/internal-docs/03-Guides/02-Advanced-Configuration.md#Reel Weights`): _"Weights are read-only at runtime — there is no setter."_
  - Observed: getReelWeights returns REEL_WEIGHTS[reelIndex] directly — a mutable number[] reference. Callers can write REEL_WEIGHTS[0][0] = 999 through this reference, mutating the live weight table at runtime with no guard.

### Unresolved doc conflicts (code ↔ reference) — run `anatoly docs arbitrate`

- `src/events.ts`::SpinEventEmitter vs `README.md` — detected 2026-05-12T20:08:21.308Z
  - Reference: Pure game logic — no UI, no persistence, no networking. … function spin(bet: Bet): SpinResult
  - Code: src/events.ts exports a `SpinEventEmitter` class (L3–L25) and a `SPIN_DONE` string constant (L27), indicating an event-driven interaction surface in the public API.
- `src/engine.ts`::spin vs `README.md` (lines 7–9) — detected 2026-05-15T19:40:00.951Z
  - Reference: import { spin } from "slot-engine";

const result = spin(10); // 10-coin bet
  - Code: The Installation guide's verification snippet calls spin with an object argument: spin({ bet: 1.0 }), and all other internal docs define Bet as a plain number with spin(bet: Bet) where Bet = number.
- `src/engine.ts`::computePayout vs `README.md` — detected 2026-05-19T12:03:14.347Z
  - Reference: Long-run player return approximates the bet-weighted house edge of 5%.
  - Code: The internal doc formula is `totalPayout = Σ(linePayout × wildMultiplier) × (1 + HOUSE_EDGE) + 0.01 × bet`, where multiplying by `(1 + 0.05)` increases payouts above the raw line sum, boosting player return rather than reducing it.

**Reclassified files:**

- `src/reels.ts`: 1 symbol(s) — Investigated all three escalated findings. The spin function's NEEDS_FIX is confirmed and strengthened: computePayout at engine.ts:105 applies house edge backwards (multiplies by 1.05 instead of 0.95), creating >100% RTP in a gambling engine — a material behavioral defect. The two duplication-based correction findings (pickFromWeighted and weightedPick) are false positives: both functions are algorithmically correct implementations of cumulative-weight sampling. Their duplication is a legitimate code smell belonging on the duplication axis, but not a correction defect. Neither function contains a bug.
- `src/rng.ts`: 1 symbol(s) — Investigated all three escalated findings. The spin function's NEEDS_FIX is confirmed and strengthened: computePayout at engine.ts:105 applies house edge backwards (multiplies by 1.05 instead of 0.95), creating >100% RTP in a gambling engine — a material behavioral defect. The two duplication-based correction findings (pickFromWeighted and weightedPick) are false positives: both functions are algorithmically correct implementations of cumulative-weight sampling. Their duplication is a legitimate code smell belonging on the duplication axis, but not a correction defect. Neither function contains a bug.

## Methodology

Each file is evaluated through 7 independent axis evaluators running in parallel.
Every symbol (function, class, variable, type) is analysed individually and receives a rating per axis along with a confidence score (0–100).
Findings with confidence < 30 are discarded; those with confidence < 60 are excluded from verdict computation.

| Axis | Model | Ratings | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Utility | sonnet | USED / DEAD / LOW_VALUE | Is this symbol actually used in the codebase? |
| Duplication | sonnet | UNIQUE / DUPLICATE | Is this symbol a copy of logic that exists elsewhere? |
| Correction | sonnet | OK / NEEDS_FIX / ERROR | Does this symbol contain bugs or correctness issues? |
| Overengineering | sonnet | LEAN / OVER / ACCEPTABLE | Is the implementation unnecessarily complex? |
| Tests | sonnet | GOOD / WEAK / NONE | Does this symbol have adequate test coverage? |
| Best Practices | sonnet | Score 0–10 | Does the file follow TypeScript best practices? |
| Documentation | sonnet | DOCUMENTED / PARTIAL / UNDOCUMENTED | Are exported symbols properly documented with JSDoc? |

See each axis folder for detailed rating criteria and methodology.

### Severity Classification

- **High**: ERROR corrections, or NEEDS_FIX / DEAD / DUPLICATE with confidence >= 80%.
- **Medium**: NEEDS_FIX / DEAD / DUPLICATE with confidence < 80%, or OVER (any confidence).
- **Low**: LOW_VALUE utility or remaining minor findings.

### Verdict Rules

- **CLEAN**: No actionable findings with confidence >= 60%.
- **NEEDS_REFACTOR**: At least one confirmed finding (DEAD, DUPLICATE, OVER, or NEEDS_FIX) with confidence >= 60%.
- **CRITICAL**: At least one ERROR correction found.

### Inter-axis Coherence

After individual evaluation, coherence rules reconcile contradictions:

- If utility = DEAD, tests is forced to NONE (no point testing dead code).
- If utility = DEAD, documentation is forced to UNDOCUMENTED (no point documenting dead code).
- If correction = ERROR, overengineering is forced to ACCEPTABLE (complexity is secondary to correctness).
