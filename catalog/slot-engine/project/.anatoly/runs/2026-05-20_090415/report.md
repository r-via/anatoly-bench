### Unresolved doc conflicts (code ↔ reference) — run `anatoly docs arbitrate`

- `src/events.ts`::SpinEventEmitter vs `README.md` — detected 2026-05-12T20:08:21.308Z
  - Reference: Pure game logic — no UI, no persistence, no networking. … function spin(bet: Bet): SpinResult
  - Code: src/events.ts exports a `SpinEventEmitter` class (L3–L25) and a `SPIN_DONE` string constant (L27), indicating an event-driven interaction surface in the public API.
- `src/engine.ts`::spin vs `README.md` (lines 7–9) — detected 2026-05-15T19:40:00.951Z
  - Reference: import { spin } from "slot-engine";

const result = spin(10); // 10-coin bet
  - Code: The Installation guide's verification snippet calls spin with an object argument: spin({ bet: 1.0 }), and all other internal docs define Bet as a plain number with spin(bet: Bet) where Bet = number.
- `src/engine.ts`::computePayout vs `README.md` — detected 2026-05-19T12:03:14.347Z
  - Reference: Long-run player return approximates the bet-weighted house edge of 5%.
  - Code: The internal doc formula is `totalPayout = Σ(linePayout × wildMultiplier) × (1 + HOUSE_EDGE) + 0.01 × bet`, where multiplying by `(1 + 0.05)` increases payouts above the raw line sum, boosting player return rather than reducing it.

## Deliberation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files deliberated | 3 |
| Symbols reclassified | 2 |
| Actions removed | 0 |
| Verdict changes | 2 |

**Verdict changes:**

- `src/reels.ts`: NEEDS_REFACTOR → CRITICAL
- `src/rng.ts`: NEEDS_REFACTOR → CRITICAL

**Reclassified files:**

- `src/reels.ts`: 1 symbol(s) — The computePayout ERROR is confirmed critical: the house-edge arithmetic at engine.ts:105 uses addition instead of subtraction, producing >100% RTP — a direct financial loss for the operator. This contradicts both the JSDoc and the project's stated 95% RTP target. The two weighted-pick duplication findings (pickFromWeighted and weightedPick) were incorrectly classified on the correction axis. Both functions are algorithmically correct and produce identical results. The duplication is real (0.823 RAG similarity score) but belongs on the duplication axis. Additionally, weightedPick is imported but never invoked at runtime — the actual call chain goes through pickFromWeighted via the factory pattern. No behavioral change risk from these two findings.

## Methodology

Each file is evaluated through 7 independent axis evaluators running in parallel.
Every symbol (function, class, variable, type) is analysed individually and receives a rating per axis along with a confidence score (0–100).
Findings with confidence < 30 are discarded; those with confidence < 60 are excluded from verdict computation.

| Axis | Model | Ratings | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Utility | haiku | USED / DEAD / LOW_VALUE | Is this symbol actually used in the codebase? |
| Duplication | haiku | UNIQUE / DUPLICATE | Is this symbol a copy of logic that exists elsewhere? |
| Correction | sonnet | OK / NEEDS_FIX / ERROR | Does this symbol contain bugs or correctness issues? |
| Overengineering | haiku | LEAN / OVER / ACCEPTABLE | Is the implementation unnecessarily complex? |
| Tests | haiku | GOOD / WEAK / NONE | Does this symbol have adequate test coverage? |
| Best Practices | sonnet | Score 0–10 | Does the file follow TypeScript best practices? |
| Documentation | haiku | DOCUMENTED / PARTIAL / UNDOCUMENTED | Are exported symbols properly documented with JSDoc? |

See each axis folder for detailed rating criteria and methodology.

### Severity Classification

- **High**: ERROR corrections, or NEEDS_FIX / DEAD / DUPLICATE with confidence >= 80%.
- **Medium**: NEEDS_FIX / DEAD / DUPLICATE with confidence < 80%, or OVER (any confidence).
- **Low**: LOW_VALUE utility or remaining minor findings.

### Verdict Rules

- **CLEAN**: No actionable findings with confidence >= 60%.
- **NEEDS_REFACTOR**: At least one confirmed finding (DEAD, DUPLICATE, OVER, or NEEDS_FIX) with confidence >= 60%.
- **CRITICAL**: At least one ERROR correction found.

### Inter-axis Coherence

After individual evaluation, coherence rules reconcile contradictions:

- If utility = DEAD, tests is forced to NONE (no point testing dead code).
- If utility = DEAD, documentation is forced to UNDOCUMENTED (no point documenting dead code).
- If correction = ERROR, overengineering is forced to ACCEPTABLE (complexity is secondary to correctness).
