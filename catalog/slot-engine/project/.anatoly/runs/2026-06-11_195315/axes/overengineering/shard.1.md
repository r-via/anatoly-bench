## 📊 Findings

| File | Verdict | Overengineering | Conf. | Details |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `src/engine.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 88% | [details](#srcenginets) |
| `src/events.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srceventsts) |
| `src/factories.ts` | 🟡 NEEDS_REFACTOR | 1 | 90% | [details](#srcfactoriests) |

## 🔍 Symbol Details

### `src/engine.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `EngineContainer` | L17–L27 | 🔴 OVER | 60% | Mini IoC container defined and used entirely within one module to hold 3 values, only one of which (`paytable`) is actually consumed. A plain object `const deps = { rng: weightedPick, paytable: getPayMultiplier, reels: { getReelSymbols, getReelWeights } }` eliminates the class, the Map, and the string-keyed untyped resolve calls with no loss of capability. |

### `src/events.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `SpinEventEmitter` | L3–L25 | 🔴 OVER | 82% | Hand-rolled on/off/emit emitter with 1 consumer reimplements Node.js built-in EventEmitter (or browser-compatible `eventemitter3`, 30M+/week) with no added behavior. NIH: the standard built-in covers this entirely with less code and no maintenance burden. |

### `src/factories.ts`

| Symbol | Lines | Overengineering | Conf. | Detail |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `StandardReelBuilderFactory` | L8–L16 | 🔴 OVER | 88% | A class wrapping a single call to spinReel in a loop. The factory pattern is unjustified: there is only one implementation, the method holds no state, and the consumer (engine.ts::spin) instantiates it just to call buildReels once. A plain exported function would eliminate the class, the abstract base, and the instantiation overhead with no loss of capability. |
